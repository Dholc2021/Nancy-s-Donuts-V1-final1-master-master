            My baby sister, Nancy Lynn Holmes, was born on December 19, 1958 in Arlington, Virginia to a Naval Aviator and his wife.  Her two older brothers welcomed her into the household not quite sure what life would be like with a little girl in the house, but Nancy soon proved to be the pride and joy of our family!  She was a ton of fun and always had a smile and a kind word.  
A tradition Nancy grew up with was enjoying donuts on Sunday mornings!  She would ride with our father to the local bakery to buy the tasty treats for breakfast before church.  She especially loved the glazed doughnuts and chocolate iced doughnuts.
Nancy married Curt Holcomb and had two boys of her own, Rob and Dan.  Her heart was as big as the great outdoors and she opened up her household to pets and strays of all kinds, cats and dogs and people.    Nancy loved foods of every description and was forever cooking for her guys and their friends.  She was a compassionate and sincere friend to everyone!
Nancy passed away in 2012, so she never saw her son Rob graduate from Delta State University, nor did she attend his wedding to Allison and of course she missed the opening of Nancy’s Donuts on November 17, 2021. But Nancy would be pleased and proud to know that Rob and Allison are doing what they love making those donuts and other treats that Nancy herself liked so much.  Try them, you’ll love them!<br><br>
